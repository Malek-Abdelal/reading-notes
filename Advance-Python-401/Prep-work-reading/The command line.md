# The command line

## The Command Line

- About the command line or terminal, It was nice to read and explore general and new information about it.

- By using the command line we are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to us similarly as text.

- One of the basic commands is 'ls', which renders the components or content of our current location(files, folders, etc ...)

## Basic Navigation

- There is a large number of commands we can use in the terminal, and this point I learned another usefull command like: 

pwd, ls, ls -l, cd .. and (Relative path Absolute path) concepts.


## More About Files

- There are some interesting characteristics of files and directories taht we have to keep it in mind as it helps with understanding the behaviour of Linux. One of them is Everything is a File, another one is Linux is an Extensionless System, we mean with this point that Linux system actually ignores the extension and looks inside the file to determine what type of file it is.

- Also Linux is Case Sensitive.

## Manual Pages

- The manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do.

So using 'man' command it will show the details of the command.

'man -k' will search within the manuals . And /<'term'> will search within a specific manual page for a term.

And 'n' will go to the next found item.

## File Manipulation

Here we learned another important commands like (mkdir, rmdir, touch, cp, mv, rm) with it's options or switches to deal with files and folders and I found it very usefull and interesting. I am so excited to go deeply into it in the future.
