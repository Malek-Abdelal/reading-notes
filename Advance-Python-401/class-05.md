## Linked List

In computer science, a **linked list** is a data structure used to store and organize a collection of elements called nodes. Each node contains two main components: data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the list. The linked list consists of a series of connected nodes, forming a linear sequence.

Here are some key **characteristics and concepts** related to linked lists:

1. **Nodes:** The basic building blocks of a linked list. Each node typically contains some data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. The last node in the list usually points to null or contains a special value to indicate the end of the list.

2. **Head:** The first node in the linked list. It provides an entry point to access the list.

3. **Tail:** The last node in the linked list. It is the node that has a reference pointing to null, indicating the end of the list.

4. **Singly Linked List:** In this type of linked list, each node contains a data element and a reference to the next node. It allows traversal only in one direction, from the head to the tail.

5. **Doubly Linked List:** In a doubly linked list, each node contains a reference to the next node and a reference to the previous node. This allows for traversal in both directions.

6. **Circular Linked List:** In a circular linked list, the last node in the list points back to the first node, forming a circle. This means that the tail's reference does not point to null but instead points to the head.

Linked lists have several advantages and disadvantages:

**Advantages:**

- **Dynamic size:** Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed, unlike fixed-size arrays.
- **Efficient insertion and deletion:** Inserting or deleting a node at the beginning or middle of the list is relatively efficient compared to arrays, which may require shifting elements.
- **Memory efficiency:** Linked lists can utilize memory efficiently since they only allocate memory for the elements they contain.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Random access:** Unlike arrays, linked lists do not provide constant-time random access to elements. Accessing an element requires traversing the list from the beginning.
- **Extra memory:** Linked lists require additional memory to store the references or pointers between nodes.
- **Sequential access:** Traversing a linked list sequentially can be slower compared to arrays due to the lack of locality in memory.

Linked lists are commonly used in various algorithms and data structures. They provide a flexible and efficient way of organizing and manipulating data.
