### Q: What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.

Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh are popular Python libraries for data visualization, each with its own set of features and use cases. Here are the key differences between them:

**Matplotlib:**

- Matplotlib is a foundational library for data visualization in Python and provides a low-level interface for creating a wide range of static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- It offers a high degree of customization, allowing you to fine-tune every aspect of a plot.
- Matplotlib is suitable for creating basic to advanced visualizations and is widely used in scientific, engineering, and academic contexts.

Example visualization: A line plot showing the temperature variation over time in a city.

**Seaborn:**

- Seaborn is a higher-level library built on top of Matplotlib that simplifies the creation of statistical visualizations.
- It provides a set of pre-defined themes and color palettes to enhance the aesthetics of plots.
- Seaborn is particularly useful for visualizing statistical relationships, exploring distributions, and creating attractive statistical plots.

Example visualization: A scatter plot with a regression line to examine the relationship between a student's study hours and their exam scores, where different hues represent different levels of a categorical variable (e.g., gender).

**Bokeh:**

- Bokeh is a library that focuses on interactive and web-based visualizations.
- It offers powerful tools for creating interactive plots, dashboards, and applications that can be easily shared and deployed on the web.
- Bokeh is designed to handle large datasets and enables interactive exploration with features like hover tooltips, zooming, and panning.

Example visualization: An interactive choropleth map showing population density across different regions, where the user can hover over each region to view detailed information.

### Q: In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case

Relational Plots:

- **scatterplot():** Creates a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two numerical variables. It represents each data point as a marker on the plot.
Example use case: Examining the correlation between a person's age and their income.

Categorical Plots:

- **barplot():** Generates a bar plot to compare categorical variables. It displays the average value of a numeric variable for each category using the height of the bars.
Example use case: Comparing the average sales of different products across different regions.

Distribution Plots:

- **histplot():** Creates a histogram to represent the distribution of a single numerical variable by dividing it into bins and counting the frequency in each bin.
Example use case: Analyzing the distribution of students' test scores in a class.
