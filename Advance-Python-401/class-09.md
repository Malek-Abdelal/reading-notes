## dunder methods in Python

Dunder methods, short for "double underscore" methods, are special methods in Python that have a specific naming convention with two leading and trailing underscores. These methods are also known as magic methods or special methods because they provide a way to define and customize the behavior of classes and objects in Python.

Dunder methods are invoked implicitly by certain language constructs or operations, such as arithmetic operations, object initialization, attribute access, and so on. By implementing these methods in your classes, you can define how instances of your class should behave when they are involved in these operations.

Here's an example of a commonly used dunder method, the `__str__` method:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Person: {self.name}"

```

the main ethical issue raised would likely revolve around intellectual property rights and fair treatment of the developer.

To avoid such ethical issues, several steps can be taken:

1. Respect Intellectual Property Rights: Developers should respect the intellectual property rights of others and ensure they have the necessary permissions or licenses to use someone else's work. Plagiarism or unauthorized use of code, content, or other creative works should be avoided.

2. Give Proper Credit: When using open-source code or incorporating someone else's work into a project, developers should provide appropriate credit to the original authors or contributors. This can be done through comments, documentation, or acknowledgments.

## Python statistics module

The Python **statistics** module is a built-in module introduced in Python 3.4 that provides a set of functions for performing various statistical operations on numerical data. It offers a convenient way to calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and more.

Here is an example to calculate the mean average of a list of numbers:

```python
import statistics
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

mean_value = statistics.mean(data)
print(mean_value)

```
output:
```
3
```

The **statistics** module provides many other useful functions, including:

- **statistics.median():** Calculates the median value of a list of numbers.
- **statistics.mode():** Finds the mode (most common value) in a list of numbers.
- **statistics.variance():** Computes the variance of a population or sample.
- **statistics.stdev():** Calculates the standard deviation of a population or sample.
