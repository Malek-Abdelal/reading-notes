## NumPy library

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides powerful data structures, mathematical functions, and tools for working with large arrays and matrices efficiently. Here are the main functionalities provided by NumPy and how it can be useful for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks:

1. Multidimensional Array Objects
2. Mathematical Functions
3. Array Operations
4. Linear Algebra
5. Random Number Generation
6. Data Manipulation
7. Integration with Other Libraries

NumPy's efficient array operations, mathematical functions, and integration with other libraries make it a vital tool for scientific computing and data manipulation in Python. It allows you to handle large datasets efficiently, perform complex mathematical computations, and streamline numerical operations. NumPy's performance and versatility make it a core component of the Python scientific computing ecosystem.

## NumPy arrays

 The basic structure in NumPy is the ndarray (n-dimensional array) object, which represents a multidimensional, homogeneous array of fixed-size items. The ndarray is a fundamental data structure in NumPy and provides efficient storage and operations on large datasets. Here are the key properties and features of NumPy arrays:

 1. **Shape:** The shape of an ndarray describes the size of each dimension of the array. It is represented as a tuple of integers. For example, a 1-dimensional array of length 5 would have a shape of (5,), a 2-dimensional array with 3 rows and 4 columns would have a shape of (3, 4), and so on.

 2. **Data Type:** NumPy arrays are homogeneous, meaning they can only contain elements of a single data type. The data type of the elements in an array is specified using NumPy's data type objects, such as numpy.int32, numpy.float64, etc. The data type can be specified explicitly when creating an array, or NumPy will infer it based on the provided data.

**how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on NumPy arrays:**

**1. Creating NumPy Arrays:**
You can create NumPy arrays using various methods. Here are a few common ways:

- From a Python list:

```python
import numpy as np

arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

arr2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

```

- Using NumPy functions:

```python
# Create a 1-dimensional array of zeros
arr3 = np.zeros(5)

arr4 = np.ones((3, 4))

arr5 = np.random.rand(2, 3, 4)

```

**2.  Accessing and Manipulating NumPy Arrays:**
You can access and manipulate elements in NumPy arrays using indexing and slicing operations:

```python
print(arr1[0])       # Output: 1
print(arr2[1, 2])    # Output: 6

print(arr1[1:4])     # Output: [2, 3, 4]
print(arr2[:, 1:])   # Output: [[2, 3], [5, 6], [8, 9]]

arr1[2] = 10
arr2[0, 1] = 20

```


**3. Array Operations:**
NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical and array operations. Here are a few examples:

```python
# Mathematical operations
result1 = np.sum(arr1)                 # Sum of all elements
result2 = np.mean(arr2)                # Mean of all elements
result3 = np.max(arr3)                 # Maximum value

# Array operations
result4 = arr1 + arr2                  # Element-wise addition
result5 = np.dot(arr2, arr2.T)          # Matrix multiplication
result6 = np.transpose(arr3)           # Transposing an array
result7 = np.concatenate((arr1, arr2)) # Concatenating arrays

```

These are just a few examples of creating, manipulating, and performing operations on NumPy arrays. NumPy provides a vast range of functions and operations that
