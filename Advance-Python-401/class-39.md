### Q: What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?

React Context is a feature in React that allows for the efficient sharing and management of state and data across components without the need to pass props down through multiple levels of the component tree. It provides a way to create a global data store that can be accessed by any component within the tree, making it easier to maintain and update shared data such as user authentication, themes, or language preferences. This helps in avoiding "prop drilling," where props have to be passed through intermediate components that don't directly use the data.

### Q: Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component.

The `useContext` hook is a part of React that enables functional components to access data from a React Context. By using this hook, you can easily retrieve and use values stored in a context without having to wrap components in a context consumer.

**Here's how it works:**

1. Import the necessary modules: Import both the useContext hook and the context you want to access.

2. Get the context value: Use the useContext hook by passing in the context object you want to access. This hook returns the current value of the context.

3. Use the context data: You can now use the data obtained from the context within your functional component just like any other variable.

### Q: Describe the purpose of Next.js, and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application. 

Next.js is a React framework that aims to simplify the development of server-rendered React applications. It provides tools and conventions for building efficient, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications by combining React components with server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and simplified routing.

**Example from Vercel Next.js Examples:**

One of the Next.js examples demonstrates building a blog application. In this scenario, the purpose is to create a scalable web application for publishing blog posts.

```python
// pages/index.js
import Link from 'next/link';
import Layout from '../components/Layout';

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link href="/blog/first-post">
            <a>First Post</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link href="/blog/second-post">
            <a>Second Post</a>
          </Link>
        </li>
        {/* More blog post links */}
      </ul>
    </Layout>
  );
}

export default HomePage;

```
