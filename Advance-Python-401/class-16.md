## Serverless Functions

### Q: What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?

Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and dynamically allocates resources to execute and scale applications. Here are the key characteristics of serverless computing and how it differs from traditional server-based architectures:

1. No server managemen
2. Event-driven architecture
3. Pay-per-use pricing
4. Automatic scaling
5. Stateless execution
6. Event-driven scaling
7. Microbilling and rapid deployment

### Q: How can one get started with Vercel, and what are the main steps involved in deploying a serverless function using Vercel?

To get started with Vercel and deploy a serverless function, you can follow these main steps:

1. Sign up for a Vercel account
2. Install Vercel CLI
3. Initialize a projec
4. Configure project settings
5. Build your serverless function
6. Test your function locally
7. Deploy your function
8. Configure domain and settings
9. Monitor and manage deployments

Following these steps will enable you to get started with Vercel and deploy your serverless function. Vercel offers additional features and integrations that can enhance your deployment workflow, such as GitHub/GitLab integrations, environment variables management, and team collaboration tools.

### Q: What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs define how different components of software systems should interact, making it possible for developers to access and manipulate data or services provided by external sources.

In Python, APIs can be utilized to access and manipulate data from external sources by following these general steps:

1. API Documentation
2. Choose an HTTP Library
3. Make HTTP Requests
4. Handle Responses
5. Data Manipulation
6. Error Handling and Rate Limiting
7. Security Considerations

### Q: What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?

The Requests library is a popular third-party library in Python that simplifies making HTTP requests to interact with APIs or web services. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly API for sending various types of HTTP requests, handling responses, and managing session-level information.

To use the Requests library, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the Requests library

```python
pip install requests

```

2. Import the Requests library

```python
import requests

```

3. Send a GET request

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')

```

4. Handle the response: The `response` object contains various attributes and methods to access the response data and handle the server's response. Some common methods include:

`response.status_code`: Returns the HTTP status code of the response (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, etc.).
`response.text`: Returns the response content as plain text.
`response.json()`: Parses the response content as JSON and returns it as a Python dictionary or list.
Here's an example of handling the response and accessing the response content:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    # Process the data further
else:
    print('Request failed with status code:', response.status_code)

```

By utilizing the Requests library in Python, you can easily send various types of HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more. The library provides additional features like setting headers, handling authentication, managing cookies and sessions, and handling redirects, allowing you to interact with APIs and consume web services efficiently.
